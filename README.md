# odin-recipes
This is the first project I am creating through The Odin Project. It will be pretty basic, but help getting my feet wet with all the basics. I am also going to use it as a way to compile a list of recipes for my own personal usage. My cooking skills are extremely basic so I'm going to use this an opportunity to expand my repertoire a bit and rehash some of the things I've cooked relatively recently. So without further ado, I'm going to get started and then I'll come back and add some post-thoughts about what I've learned and any issues that I had along the way.
